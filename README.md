# my-blog

A blog on Cloudflare Workers, running [lily](https://github.com/kan/lily) (`@kanf/lily`).

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/kan/lily/tree/main/template)

**A Worker, a D1 database and an R2 bucket is the whole stack.** Posts live in D1, images
live in R2, and the admin UI ships prebuilt inside the package — there is no build step for
it, and no Vue toolchain on your side.

## Deploying with the button

The button copies this directory into a repository of your own, creates the D1 database and
the R2 bucket from the bindings in `wrangler.jsonc`, asks for the secrets listed in
`.dev.vars.example` (that is where the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` field comes from), and runs
`npm run deploy` — which applies lily's migrations and then deploys.

**A Cloudflare account is all it needs.** Nothing has to be created beforehand, and no
resource ID is ever pasted into the repository: the bindings are referenced by name.

Afterwards, set `site.url` in `src/config.ts` to the URL you are actually serving from (your
domain, or the `*.workers.dev` one) and push — it is the origin every absolute URL in the
feeds and `<link rel="canonical">` is built from.

### What the button asks of your GitHub account

Copying this directory means **creating a repository**, so Cloudflare's GitHub app has to be
installed with room to make one. A repository that does not exist yet cannot be picked from
the "only select repositories" list, so the grant starts out wider than the one repository
you are about to get.

It does not have to stay that way. Once the deploy is done, GitHub → *Settings* →
*Applications* → *Cloudflare Workers and Pages* → *Repository access* → **Only select
repositories** narrows it to the blog, and *Uninstall* on the same page removes it entirely.

**Or skip GitHub altogether.** The Git connection exists so that pushing redeploys you; it is
not how the Worker gets deployed. Copy this directory, keep it wherever you like, and use the
commands below — nothing in lily needs a repository, and writing a post never touches one
either, because posts live in D1.

## Running it locally

```bash
npm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars   # put a password in ADMIN_PASSWORD (12 characters or more)
npm run db:migrate:local         # create the tables in the local D1
npm run dev                      # http://localhost:8787
```

The admin UI is at `/admin/`. Without a password in `.dev.vars` it still opens locally: lily
falls back to the `localhostOnly` adapter, which only lets a request through when the host is
`localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. **That fallback cannot pass in production**, so forgetting the
secret does not leave the door open — it leaves it shut.

## Deploying from your machine

Without the button, the same thing by hand:

```bash
npx wrangler login
npm run deploy:first                      # the first time only (see below)
npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_PASSWORD    # 12 characters or more
```

Every deploy after that is `npm run deploy`.

**The two are not the same order, on purpose.** The D1 database and the R2 bucket are created
during the first `wrangler deploy`, from the bindings in `wrangler.jsonc`, so on the first run
there is nothing to migrate yet and the deploy has to come first. From then on the migrations
run **before** the deploy, so new code never meets an old schema.

## What is where

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/config.ts` | **Everything site-specific**: name, URL, language, time zone, OGP image, which auth adapter, Bluesky |
| `src/index.ts` | The Worker entry point. Two lines, unless you add a scheduled backup |
| `public/` | Files served at the site root (`favicon.ico`, `ogp.png`, …). Create it if you need it, and list the names in `assets` in `src/config.ts` |
| `wrangler.jsonc` | Bindings, the assets directory, and the Text rule the theme's CSS needs |
| `.dev.vars.example` | The secrets this blog takes. Also what the *Deploy to Cloudflare* screen asks for |

`npm run build` merges `public/` and lily's prebuilt admin UI into `dist/`, which is what
`wrangler.jsonc` serves. It is a single command (`lily-assets`) that ships with lily, because
lily is what knows where its admin build lives.

## Writing posts

Everything happens in the admin UI: writing, drag-and-drop images, tags, scheduling the
publication time, changing a post's URL (the old one keeps working), previewing a draft
through a shareable link.

**Nothing about a post lives in this repository.** The source of truth is D1, so writing a
post means no commit and no deploy. To take your posts out — or to move them in from a static
site generator — use the export and import in the admin UI: a zip of
`posts/<path>/index.md` plus the images next to it, readable without lily.

## Backups (optional)

A daily copy of that same portable archive, in a second R2 bucket:

1. Add the bucket and a cron trigger in `wrangler.jsonc` (the commented block at the bottom).
2. Turn `src/index.ts` into a handler with a `scheduled` function:

```ts
import { runBackup } from '@kanf/lily';
import { lily } from './config';

export default {
  fetch: lily.fetch,
  async scheduled(_controller, env: Env) {
    // await it: handing this to waitUntil would make the handler succeed either way.
    await runBackup(env.DB, env.MEDIA, env.BACKUP, { keep: 30 });
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Generations are counted, not dated — 30 archives are kept, so the last one taken survives
however long the cron was down.

## Images through Cloudflare Images (optional)

Add `"images": { "binding": "IMAGES" }` to `wrangler.jsonc` and `media: { images: true }` to
the config. Attachments are then converted to AVIF or WebP at delivery time, **and fall back
to the original** on any failure. The URLs do not change either way, so turning it off later
rewrites nothing.

## Making it look different

`theme: defaultTheme` is a `Theme` implementation — four functions and one stylesheet. Copy
`node_modules/@kanf/lily/dist/lib/theme` into your own `src/theme/`, change what you want, and
pass yours instead. The theme receives the data for a page and nothing else; URLs are built
for it, so a copied theme keeps working if you move the blog to a subpath.
